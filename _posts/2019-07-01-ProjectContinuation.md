title: BRCloud Research Project
---

It is my pleasure to announce that our work is getting pursued in the new
BRCloud research project (more information [here](https://gitlab.com/brcloud)).
For this project, we have developed a new runtime implementation relying on MPI.
The new runtime offers largely improved performance and task-based
parallelization.
