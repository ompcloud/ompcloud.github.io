title: New Release v0.2.0
---

It is my pleasure to announce that OmpCloud v0.2.0 is now available.
Get it [here](https://github.com/ompcloud/ompcloud/releases/tag/v0.2.0)!
This new version is largely improving the usability of OmpCloud so do not be
afraid to try it! Indeed, this release is the result of the feedback we got from
the students which experimented OmpCloud during the course of parallel
programming at UNICAMP. Please notice that the documentation available
[in the wiki](https://github.com/ompcloud/ompcloud/wiki) has also been improved.
