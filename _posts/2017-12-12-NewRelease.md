title: New Release v0.3.0
---

It is my pleasure to announce that OmpCloud v0.3.0 is now available.
Get it [here](https://github.com/ompcloud/ompcloud/releases/tag/v0.3.0)!
This new version is adding support for older versions of Ubuntu (at least 14.04)
and RPM-based distributions (experimental), and also adding support to loop
scheduling model of OpenMP (static/dynamic, chuncksize).
